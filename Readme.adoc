**Email** address is split into two columns as a weak anti-spam obfuscation.

**Key ID** is the last 16 hex characters of your primary/main/Certify key.
You can get this by running `gpg --keyid-format 0xlong -k youremail@example.com` and looking at the first line.

**Proof** is a signed attestation like https://adammonsen.com/seagl-2025-keysigning-party-proof/[this].

**Signed key sharing preference** tells folks what to do with your key after they sign it.
